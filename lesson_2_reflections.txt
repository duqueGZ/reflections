What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a git repository, git creates all the data structured that it needs in order to track all the
changes and related info about the files in the repository. It is necessary to do this, because is the way that
you let git know that that directory would be a repository (so, it must to track it) and not an ordinary file
directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is the normal file directory in your file system. It can contains files that you want to keep
tracked on the repository and other files that you want the repository to ignore them. Meanwhile, the repository is
where git keep the files actually tracked. When you commit some changes, they go to the repository. Furthermore, the
staging area is like a halfway place where you can add each changed file that you would want to include in your next
commit to the repository. That's allow you not to include always all the changed files in your commit, but choose only
those files that you want to keep logically together in the same change commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You choose what changed files you include in the staging area before a commit. Then, using "git diff --staged" you can
actually know what changes are going to be commited, because this command compares the staging area with the most
recent commit in the repository (and that is what is going to be commited). If the changes returned by this command
contain a unique logical change, you are right and sure that you are going to make one commit per logical change.
