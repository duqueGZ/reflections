When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It's useful when working in a team in the same project. Each of you can work independently and locally in your own
computer and local repository and then share your progress with the rest of the team by pushing your changes to
the remote repository, that all the team share. It's also helpful when you want to share with the community some of
your projects (either working in a team or only by yourself). And for that, using GitHub makes easy to do it.
